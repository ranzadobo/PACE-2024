      "user": "I threw out my gift card so I don't have it anymore. Is it possible for me to get the refund on my credit card?",
      "assistant": "If you no longer have the gift card, it's best to explain the situation to our customer service team. They may be able to verify the original transaction and process the refund on a different method if possible.\n\nIn many cases, the store policy may require the original payment method for refunds, but it’s worth discussing your situation with them. If you need help with this process, the customer service team at the store will be your best point of contact."
