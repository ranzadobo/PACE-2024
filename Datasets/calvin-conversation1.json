    },
    {
      "user": "What is my total price after the discount?",
      "chatbot": "To calculate your total price after the discount, I’ll need to know the current price of the Nike LeBron 21 shoes in your size and any applicable taxes or shipping fees. For example, if the shoes are priced at $200 and you have a 10% membership discount, the calculation would be as follows: 1. Original Price: $200 2. Membership Discount (10%): $200 x 0.10 = $20 3. Price After Discount: $200 - $20 = $180 If there are additional shipping costs, those would be added to the final total. Please provide the current price or let me know if you need assistance with anything else!"
    },
    {
      "user": "Can I purchase it now and pick it up later?",
      "chatbot": "Yes, you can purchase the Nike LeBron 21 shoes now and choose the in-store pickup option. When you place your order, you can select the 'Pick Up In Store' option during checkout. Once your order is ready, you’ll receive a notification, and you can come by the store to pick it up at your convenience. Would you like me to help you with the purchase process or provide any more details?"
    },
    {
      "user": "When is the earliest I can pick it up?",
      "chatbot": "The earliest you can pick up your order usually depends on the store’s processing time. Typically, for in-store pickup, it takes around 1-2 hours for the order to be ready after purchase. If you place the order now, you can generally expect it to be ready for pickup later today or early tomorrow, depending on the store’s specific schedule and availability. If you need exact timing or have any other questions, I’d be happy to assist further!"

    {
      "user": "Yes, I will just order it right now and pick it up later at the store in Sydney CBD.",
